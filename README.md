# MSCS532 – Assignment 1: Getting Started with Python and Insertion Sort

## 📌 Overview

This assignment introduces the foundational setup for Python development using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, GitHub, and basic algorithm implementation. The goal is to:

* Set up a Python environment
* Configure VS Code with necessary extensions
* Create a GitHub account and public repository
* Implement and commit an insertion sort algorithm in **monotonically decreasing order**

## ✅ Setup Summary

* **Python version**: 3.11
* **IDE used**: Visual Studio Code with Python and Code Runner extensions
* **Repository name**: `MSCS532_Assignment1`
* **Repository link**: *\[Insert your GitHub repo URL here]*

## 🔁 Insertion Sort (Descending)

The Python script included implements the **Insertion Sort** algorithm that sorts a list in strictly decreasing order. The function `insertion_sort_desc()` takes a sequence and returns a sorted list from highest to lowest.

### ▶️ Sample Output

```python
Original : [23, 1, 8, 42, -5, 17]
Sorted ↓  : [42, 23, 17, 8, 1, -5]
```

## 💡 Key Concepts Practiced

* Python data types and control flow
* Algorithm design (based on Chapter 2 from *Introduction to Algorithms*, Cormen et al.)
* Version control with Git and GitHub
* IDE configuration for efficient development

## 📂 Files Included

* `assignment1.py` – main source file containing the sorting algorithm
* `README.md` – this documentation file

## 📝 Commit History

The repository includes **at least 3 meaningful commits** demonstrating the development process:

1. Initial insertion sort implementation
2. Added sample output and input
3. Final refinements and cleanup
